The first visualization model that we created was a variable importance chart, which helped us in determining which predictors we wanted to use in our final model to get the most accurate predictions. From this visualization, we saw that halftime results, shots on goal home, and shots on goal away were the most important variables and so these were the ones we chose to use in our final model. After creating our model, we used the OOB to test the accuracy of our model on unseen data points. Our OOB was 31.84% which means misclassified 31.84% of new data points, but from this we can conclude that we correctly classified 68.16% of new data points. This relatively high percentage of correct classifications, and somewhat low OOB rate, tells us that our model is relatively good at predicting full time results for new data points. All of the data used to build this model was ethically collected, and therefore gives us a fair model. We also created a confusion matrix and from this we were able to conclude that our model is best at predicting home team wins, with a calculated accuracy rate of about 81%.
